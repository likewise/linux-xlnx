Xilinx VPHY (Early Access Release)

The Xilinx Video PHY is a video-specific wrapper around different versions of the GT PHY. The
corresponding driver is phy/phy-xilinx-vphy.

It is tightly coupled with its current sole user HDMI RXSS, see xlnx,v-hdmirxss.txt

The main configuration is currently fixed and built-in the driver, only the resource address and
interrupt are configurable here.

At least one lane reference must be made (by HDMI RX) to get a handle to the vphy driver. The
(currently 4) arguments are not used and subject to change or removal. The vphy reference
is subject to change.
