Xilinx HDMI RX Subsystem (Early Access Release)

The Xilinx HDMI RX Subsystem contains several subcores to implement a HDMI receiver. The Linux
driver media/platform/xilinx/xilinx-hdmi-rx implements a V4L video-capture sub-device for the
Xilinx Video IP Pipeline device (xilinx-vipp).

The main configuration is currently fixed and built-in the driver, only the resource address and
interrupt and logic clock are configurable here.

The HDMI RXSS is tightly coupled with the Xilinx Video PHY, a video specific wrapper around the GT PHY.

phys is a list of VPHY SerDes lanes used by HDMI RX SS. See xlnx,vphy.txt.

phy-names must be hdmi-phy0 etc.
