Xilinx VPHY (Staging)

The Xilinx Video PHY is a high-level video-specific wrapper around
different versions of the GT PHY. Its driver is phy/phy-xilinx-vphy.c

It offers the PHY driver interface as well as higher-level video
specific support functions.

Its current users are Xilinx HDMI RX/TX SS.
(See xlnx,v-hdmi-rx-ss.txt and xlnx,v-hdmi-tx-ss.txt)

Required properties (port (child) nodes):
lane0:
- #phy-cells	: Should be 4
		  Cell after port phandle is device type from:
			- <controller_type controller_instance is_shared direction_tx>

controller_type = 0 for HDMI
controller_instance = [0, ...] indexes the instance of the protocol controller
is_shared = 1 if the RX and TX can be shared across the same protocol/controller
direction_tx = 0 for RX and 1 for TX

(These properties are intended for future steering of multiple protocols sharing VPHYs,
and are therefore subject to change.)

An example is, with comments for work-in-progress (TODO):

	vphy: vphy@a0000000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,vphy-1.1";
		reg = <0x0 0xa0000000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 92 4>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;

		clocks = <&vid_s_axi_clk>;
		clock-names = "axi-lite";

		/* these are created by the device tree generator */
		/* these are required and handled in the driver */
		xlnx,input-pixels-per-clock = <0x2>;
		xlnx,nidru = <0x1>;
		xlnx,nidru-refclk-sel = <0x4>;
		xlnx,rx-no-of-channels = <0x3>;

		/* @TODO these are NOT yet created by the device tree generator */
		/* these are not not required by the driver, but are used if present */
		/* (!!) if not present here, they get a hard-coded value in the driver (!!) */
		xlnx,transceiver-type = <0x5>;
		xlnx,tx-buffer-bypass = <0x1>;

		vphy_lane0: vphy_lane@0 {
