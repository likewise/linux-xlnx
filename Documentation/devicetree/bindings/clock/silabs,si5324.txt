Binding for Silicon Labs Si5324 programmable i2c clock multiplier.

The Si5324 is a programmable i2c clock generator with two output clocks.
The internal structure of the clock generators can be found in [1].

==I2C device node==

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of "silabs,si5324".
- reg: i2c device address, shall be 0x60 or 0x61.
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1.
- clocks: from common clock binding; list of parent clock
  handles, shall be xtal reference clock or clkin1 or clkin2
  Corresponding clock input names are "xtal", "clkin1", "clkin2".
- #address-cells: shall be set to 1.
- #size-cells: shall be set to 0.

Optional properties:
- silabs,pll-source: pair of (number, source). Allows
  to overwrite clock source of pll.

==Child nodes==

Each of the clock outputs can be overwritten individually by
using a child node to the I2C device node. If a child node for a clock
output is not set, the eeprom configuration is not overwritten.

Required child node properties:
- reg: number of clock output.

Optional child node properties:
- silabs,drive-strength: output drive strength in mA, shall be one of {2,4,6,8}.
- silabs,pll-master: boolean, multisynth can change pll frequency.
- silabs,disable-state : clock output disable state, shall be
  0 = clock output is driven LOW when disabled
  1 = clock output is driven HIGH when disabled
  2 = clock output is FLOATING (HIGH-Z) when disabled
  3 = clock output is NEVER disabled

==Example==

/* 114.285MHz reference crystal (x9 on ZCU102 rev. D1 ) */
refhdmi: hdmi-reference {
	compatible = "fixed-clock";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-frequency = <114285000>;
};

i2c-master-node {

	/* Si5324 i2c clock generator */
	si5324: clock-generator@68 {
		compatible = "silabs,si5324";
		reg = <0x68>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;

		/* connect xtal input to 114.285MHz reference crystal */
		clocks = <&refhdmi>;
		clock-names = "xtal";

		/* connect xtal input as source of pll */
		silabs,pll-source = <0 0>;

		/*
		 * overwrite clkout0 configuration with:
		 * - 8mA output drive strength
		 * - clkout0 can change pll0
		 * - set initial clock frequency of 297MHz
		 */
		clkout0 {
			reg = <0>;
			silabs,drive-strength = <8>;
			silabs,pll-master;
			clock-frequency = <297000000>;
		};

		/*
		 * overwrite clkout1 configuration with:
		 * - 4mA output drive strength
		 * - clkout1 can change pll1
		 */
		clkout1 {
			reg = <1>;
			silabs,drive-strength = <4>;
			pll-master;
		};
	};
};
